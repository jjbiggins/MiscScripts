## General

autobuild.sh will generate a file 'opensips.run' and send emails to the receivers. Add cron will auto build at every day's 0:00. This script also push the release file to remote server. Then you can call ./opensips.run on remote server to install opensips. 

## Useage

1. First, you need a user maybe named builder or any else to build opensips, and sudo permission too.
2. Add this script to PATH, maybe ~/bin. Make sure the *.sh files have execute access.
3. Add a cron tab with something like this 
'0 0 * * * /home/builder/bin/autobuild.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &'
4. You need modify email.conf for the receivers.
5. You need to modify the push server where scp pushs the file 'opensips.run'. Maybe need setup auth key of remote server.
6. You need to modify script's location if necessary, for example my file tree is:
.
```bash
├── bin
│   ├── autobuild.sh
│   ├── mail.cfg
│   └── make.sh
└── opensips
    └── install
        ├── build.sh
        ├── makeself-header.sh
        └── makeself.sh
```
